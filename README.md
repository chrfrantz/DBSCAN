# DBSCAN
Lightweight Java implementation of density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN

## Download/Building

You can download the latest jar file from the releases page.

To build the library, you can either compile the sources manually or use maven (`mvn clean package`).

## Usage

* Implement a distance metric for the data type to be clustered (using the interface `org.christopherfrantz.dbscan.DistanceMetric`; for an example see the implementation `org.christopherfrantz.dbscan.metrics.DistanceMetricNumbers` or consult the tests).
* Instantiate `DBSCANClusterer`.
* Invoke `performClustering()` to retrieve the clustered inputs. See tests for examples.
